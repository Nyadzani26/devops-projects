# Server Performance Stats

This project is part of my DevOps learning journet following [https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats).
It provides a Bash script ('server-stats.sh') to quickly analyse essential server performance metrics.
The script is lightweight and can run on any Linux system.
