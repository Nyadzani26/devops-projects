# 🚀 DevOps Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **DevOps projects portfolio** 👋  
This repository contains hands-on projects I’m completing as part of my DevOps learning journey, inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) and other resources.  

The goal of this repo is to **learn by building**, covering everything from Linux basics to advanced DevOps tools like CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Containers, Kubernetes, and Cloud.
